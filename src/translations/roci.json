To assess how the implementation of Microsoft Defender CSPM would impact this risk, we conducted a new quantification, altering only one variable: the addition of the product. This allowed us to simulate the company's cyber risk landscape as if the product had been fully integrated into their cloud operations. The analysis you will see in this chapter reflects the outcome of these adjustment, offering a comparative view of risk reduction.",

This approach aligns with the fact that Microsoft Defender CSPM is a cloud-focused security product. By limiting the enhancements to cloud-related controls, we can more accurately assess the product's impact on the organization's cloud security posture, ensuring that the results of the quantification are relevant and reflective of the product's intended use case."
